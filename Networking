### 1. Networking Basics
- #### IP Addressing
   Understand IPv4 and IPv6, including subnetting and CIDR notation.

- #### MAC Addresses
   Know how devices are uniquely identified at the hardware level within local networks.

- #### Ports and Protocols
   Common protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS, etc.), their associated ports, and how they're used.

### 2. OSI and TCP/IP Models
- #### OSI Model
   Familiarize yourself with the seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application), which provide a framework for understanding how data moves across networks.

- #### TCP/IP Model
   Focus on the four layers (Link, Internet, Transport, and Application) more directly used in modern networking.

### 3. Routing and Switching
- #### Routing
   Learn how routers manage traffic across networks, including routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF).

- #### Switching
   Understand how switches operate within local networks and how they differ from routers, including VLANs and network segmentation.

### 4. Network Security Fundamentals
- #### Firewalls and Access Control
   Explore how firewalls, both hardware and software, control traffic based on security rules.

- #### NAT (Network Address Translation)
   Learn how NAT hides internal IP addresses for security and network management.

- #### VPNs and Encryption
   Look into secure ways to connect remote users and encrypt data in transit.

### 5. Tools and Protocol Analysis
- #### Packet Sniffing
   Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.

- #### Network Scanning
   Familiarize yourself with tools like Nmap to map out networks, identify devices, and check for open ports.

### 6. Network Attacks and Defense
- #### Common Attack Types
   Understand attacks such as DDoS, MITM, spoofing, and ARP poisoning.

- #### Detection and Prevention
   Learn how intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) work and how they monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
