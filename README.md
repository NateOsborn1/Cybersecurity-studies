### 1. Networking Basics
- #### IP Addressing
   Understand IPv4 and IPv6, including subnetting and CIDR notation.
  - ##### IPv4
    Consists of 32-bit addresses, divided into four 8-bit sections separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    This format supports around 4.3 billion addresses.
  - ##### IPv6
    Uses 128-bit addresses to allow more devices. They look much longer (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
  - ##### Subnetting
    Splits IP networks into smaller sections, allowing efficient allocation of addresses. For example, 192.168.1.0/24
    is a subnet that divides the IP space into chunks of 256 addresses.
  - ##### CIDR Notation
    Represents IP ranges compactly (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24 shows a block where 24 bits are fixed, and the remaining bits
    are for device addresses).
  - ##### Testing:
    Ping: using the ping command in terminal to test connectivity to an IP address, like ping 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS). It will show data packets being sent and received.

    Traceroute: Run tracert [IP address] (on Windows) or traceroute [IP address] (on macOS/Linux) to see the path data      takes across networks to reach a target IP.

- #### MAC Addresses
   Know how devices are uniquely identified at the hardware level within local networks. Operates at a Layer 2
   (Data Link) of the OSI model, which manages local network communication. A MAC address typically looks like
   00:1A:2B:3C:4B:5E.

   They are critical in switching environments because switches use them to direct data to the correct device within a network
   Unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses don't change. They're assigned by the device's manufacturer and are permanently associated with that piece of hardware.
  - ##### Testing:
    Find MAC Address: Use the command ipconfig /all on Windows or ifconfig /ip link on macOS/Linux to view the view the MAC addresses of your network interfaces.

    ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Try using arp -a to see a table of IP addresses and their associated MAC addresses in your local network, showing how devices communicate at both the IP and MAC levels.

- #### Ports and Protocols
   Common protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS, etc.), their associated ports, and how they're used.

### 2. OSI and TCP/IP Models
- #### OSI Model
   Familiarize yourself with the seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application), which provide a framework for understanding how data moves across networks.

- #### TCP/IP Model
   Focus on the four layers (Link, Internet, Transport, and Application) more directly used in modern networking.

### 3. Routing and Switching
- #### Routing
   Learn how routers manage traffic across networks, including routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF).

- #### Switching
   Understand how switches operate within local networks and how they differ from routers, including VLANs and network segmentation.

### 4. Network Security Fundamentals
- #### Firewalls and Access Control
   Explore how firewalls, both hardware and software, control traffic based on security rules.

- #### NAT (Network Address Translation)
   Learn how NAT hides internal IP addresses for security and network management.

- #### VPNs and Encryption
   Look into secure ways to connect remote users and encrypt data in transit.

### 5. Tools and Protocol Analysis
- #### Packet Sniffing
   Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.

- #### Network Scanning
   Familiarize yourself with tools like Nmap to map out networks, identify devices, and check for open ports.

### 6. Network Attacks and Defense
- #### Common Attack Types
   Understand attacks such as DDoS, MITM, spoofing, and ARP poisoning.

- #### Detection and Prevention
   Learn how intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) work and how they monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
